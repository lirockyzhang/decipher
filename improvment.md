   1. Architecture: The current architecture is solid but could benefit from better dependency management and reduced global state
   2. Performance: Implement more efficient algorithms for the AI agents and optimize DOM operations
   3. Security: Add input validation and sanitization where needed
   4. User Experience: Add loading indicators, game statistics, and enhanced accessibility
   5. Maintainability: Create configuration modules, use dependency injection, and improve error handling
   6. Scalability: Implement persistence interfaces and prepare for potential server-side features
